24-06-2020 Stuart Miller / Paul Rütter
- Stuart Miller added support for having prebuilt binaries for all supported Node.js versions.

16-10-2019 Paul Rütter
- 1.2.0
- Node 12 support.
- Still some deprecated API's are used, which should be avoided.
See https://github.com/joyeecheung/node/blob/v8-maybe-doc/CPP_STYLE_GUIDE.md#use-maybe-version-of-v8-apis
- Adjusted test script a bit, by removing some flags which seem to complicate nodejs 12 support.

02-09-2019 Paul Rütter
- 1.2.0-beta.0
- Updated dependencies (nan update is needed for nodejs 12)
- Add nodejs 12 to travis
- Add experimental node 12 support. Still some deprecated API's are used, which should be avoided.
See https://github.com/joyeecheung/node/blob/v8-maybe-doc/CPP_STYLE_GUIDE.md#use-maybe-version-of-v8-apis

02-01-2019 Paul Rütter
- 1.1.4
- Updated dependencies
- Add travis file to trigger a build. Just run a dummy script which does nothing; the default "npm install" will check if the native module compiles.

09-06-2018 Paul Rütter
- 1.1.3 - Updated dependencies, to mitigate security issues.

02-20-2018 Paul Rütter
- 1.1.2 - Fixed heapdump generation on Unix machines.
- Added option to use the "old" implementation (GCmonitoring), as the new implementatuion is more prone to run in with the OoM killer when in memory restricted environments (like Docker). The old implementation was less impacted by this, because the "threshold" parameter can be used to create the heapdump earlier.
You can specify which OoM implementation to use, either: "NATIVE_HOOK" (default) or "GC_MONITORING" (old implementation).

02-19-2018 Paul Rütter
- 1.1.0 - Changed the way the "out of memory" heapdump is created, based on the work of 'trevnorris' (https://github.com/trevnorris/node-ofe/blob/master/ofe.cc). Using V8 engine isolate.SetOOMErrorHandler() to hook in on the out of memory event.
- Updated readme and removed deprecated 'limit' and 'threshold' parameters.
- Removed 'gc-stats' module, as we no longer need it with the native C++ add-on.

02-13-2018 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.12 - Use 'require-main-filename' instead of require.main.filename, to resolve 'https://github.com/blueconic/node-oom-heapdump/issues/3'.
- Upgrade dependencies

11-21-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.11 - Added port verification; when the module is loaded, the configured WebSocket port is verified. If the websocket responds with ECONNREFUSED, the process might have been started without the --inspect flag.

11-17-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.10 - Use gc-stats to calculate when to make a OoM heapdumo instead of process.memoryUsage() as this memory information (heapTotal) is growing over time, which is not expected.
- Stringify gc-stats output, so it runs over only 1 line.

06-10-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.9 - Handle exit codes better and reject promise if so.

05-10-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.8 - Add CPU profile functionality.

04-10-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.7 - Add addTimestamp option.

04-10-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.6 - Add limit option.

03-10-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.5 - Change heap calculation.

03-10-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.4 - Add error handler in case the calling process is not running anymore. Also, block execution a while to allow heapdump to be created.

01-10-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.3 - Minor doc changes.

01-10-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.2 - Refactored code; split up API and implementation. Also added API for creating heapdumps on the fly. Documentation updated.

29-09-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.1 - minor changed

29-09-2017 - Paul Rütter
- 1.0.1 - initial version
